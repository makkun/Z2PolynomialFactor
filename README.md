# Z2PolynomialFactor
A Program in c++ to do the factorization of polynomials in Z2 ( GF(2) )
It use binaries as a representation for polynomials and Berlekamp factorization algorithm. You can see it on Knuth Vol2 "The Art of computer programming" or others sources.

I just posted because of the work it gave me.
